This is to play around with rust in a local docker contianer, nothing fancy but windows, IT and I aren't on great terms, besides docker seems like an easier way to compile stuff in windows given the multitude of issues I've been having with well everything regarding setup.

I just start a container from the ~rust:latest~ image and then connect with the terminal

#+begin_src shell
docker run --name sandbox -v c:/Users/adanaos/git/:/git -di rust:latest

docker exec -it sandbox bash
#+end_src


but because copying and pasting is a pain I created ~sandbox-start.sh~ to run the above command. Likewise I've added the alias ~jkrust~ to my .bashrc to execute bash on the sandbox
